## Overview
This project describes the design and development of an Augmented Reality based book for teaching and making it playful learning of stories and information about various animals to preschool children. Used together with the camera, children could view the superimposed virtual characters and story in a fun and interactive manner with the interactions too. Generally, teaching young children could be difficult this is due to the focus of young children is different from the elderly since they could only focus on something for a short period of time. Introducing fun and interactive learning could grab the attention, therefore, enhance teaching and learning for young learners.

There is another section in the section which has a play mode or say a game mode, which includes various fun factors like different animal characters in the jungle and forest environment. A variety of animations are provided to make it more appealing such as eating, sleeping, running, and hunting, all these are integrated with sounds and effects so as to make the whole experience more realistic.
